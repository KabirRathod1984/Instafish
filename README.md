# 📷 Instafish

A realistic clone of an Instagram login screen designed to raise awareness of cybersecurity and ethical phishing scenarios.  Credentials entered by the user are recorded and transmitted to a webhook URL that has been set up.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User visits the fake Instagram login page.
2. They enter their **username and password**.
3. Credentials are sent via POST request to your **webhook URL**.
4. ⚠️ For security purposes, there is no redirection to the real Instagram website after form submission. This behavior is intentionally disabled.
